  heading: Welcome
  text: Hi, I'm Harry a technical designer in my second year at Staffordshire
    University studying Computer Gameplay Design and Production. In this
    portfolio you can go through all of my current projects I have been working
    on and also some of my past projects too
intro:
  heading: What you can expect to see
  text: "The engines I work with is Unreal Engine 4/5 and Unity, so you can expect
    to see my different projects using these engines. In my projects I mainly
    focus on the programming side of things trying to make intuitive and
    exciting gameplay. I love developing modular systems because I love the
    complexity of them. "

    text: Here is my Unreal Engine 4 project from last semester where we had to make
      a game centred around pawn switching, therefore i developed a open world
      mad max inspired car game. In it you can drive different cars and
      customise them with different parts which you can put on and take off the
      car.

    text: Here is a project which I'm still developing for university called
      Combine, it is a 1st person shooter developed in unity. In the game you
      will have realistic firing mechanics with recoil, aiming down sights and
      in world scopes. These features are already in the game, next i will be
      developing a modular weapon system where you will be able to change every
      part of the gun which will effect the weapons stats and feel using a
      PCG(procedural content generation system).

  heading: My Passions
  text: >-
    When it comes to game development i love modular systems and creating
    dynamic and interesting mechanics, as you've seen by my two projects above
    both of them utilize modular systems. I just love using multiplicative
    design and making 3 mechanics but those mechanics have interactions with
    each other.


    Outside of game development I love playing games with my friends and I also love producing music on the side, i just find making music really relaxing.
