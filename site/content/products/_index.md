  heading: Semester 1 Unreal Engine
  description: This project we had to develop a prototype game which involved pawn
    switching, my idea for this was making a open world sandbox game where you
    traverse the dunes escaping zombies and collecting cars which you can then
    modify. I developed a modular system where you can attach parts onto the
    cars and modify there look to you hearts content. For this project I used a
    Synty's Polygon Apocalypse pack for the majority of assets and Quixel
    Megascans for the terrain and a section of the UK's heightmap for the
    landscape.

  heading: Year 2 Unity Project (Combine)
  description: "For my Unity module this year i decided to develop a FPS which
    incorporates a Escape From Tarkov style weapon customisation however i
    wanted this customisation to be done in real time so that the player feels
    more immersed. I really wanted to strive towards realism and immersion for
    this project. Currently i have the basic mechanics of a FPS: Shooting,
    Dynamic reloading, Dynamic camera recoil, In world scopes and really basic
    AI. The next things i plan to implement is the weapon customising which i
    plan to use a PCG(procedural content generation) system for and then in
    world UI to allow the player to customise their weapons."
