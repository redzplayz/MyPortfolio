  text: Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too –
    one of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives.
    We want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
    exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.

    text: Here is my Unreal Engine 4 project from last semester where we had to make
      a game centred around pawn switching, therefore i developed a open world
      mad max inspired car game. In it you can drive different cars and
      customise them with different parts which you can put on and take off the
      car.

    text: Here is a project which I'm still developing for university called
      Combine, it is a 1st person shooter developed in unity. In the game you
      will have realistic firing mechanics with recoil, aiming down sights and
      in world scopes. These features are already in the game, next i will be
      developing a modular weapon system where you will be able to change every
      part of the gun which will effect the weapons stats and feel using a
      PCG(procedural content generation system).

  text: "The engines I work with is Unreal Engine 4/5 and Unity, so you can expect
    to see my different projects using these engines. In my projects I mainly
    focus on the programming side of things trying to make intuitive and
    exciting gameplay. I love developing modular systems because I love the
    complexity of them. "

  heading: How I got started in games?
  description: When i was in year 7 in high school i started experiments with
    making games in scratch and i was hooked then as i grew up i learnt more
    engines, in year 9 it was game maker, in year 10 unity then when I went to
    college i started to learn Unreal Engine 4. Throughout this time I learnt
    that i loved programming and designing and then making those mechanics come
    to life. I was never an artist but I feel like creating these mechanics was
    my form of art.
