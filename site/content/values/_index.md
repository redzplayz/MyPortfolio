  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.

    text: Here is my Unreal Engine 4 project from last semester where we had to make
      a game centred around pawn switching, therefore i developed a open world
      mad max inspired car game. In it you can drive different cars and
      customise them with different parts which you can put on and take off the
      car.

    text: Here is a project which I'm still developing for university called
      Combine, it is a 1st person shooter developed in unity. In the game you
      will have realistic firing mechanics with recoil, aiming down sights and
      in world scopes. These features are already in the game, next i will be
      developing a modular weapon system where you will be able to change every
      part of the gun which will effect the weapons stats and feel using a
      PCG(procedural content generation system).
