    text: 'I started learning about game development in year 7 of high school where
      I made my first "game" in scratch which was a 2 player top down racing
      game, this sparked my interest into games and as i grew up  through high
      school i branched out more and more. In year 9 i started to look into game
      maker and then year 10 I started unity. When I left high school I decided
      to do game development at college, here i learned more about game maker
      and also started using Unreal engine 4. At this point I knew that game
      development is what i wanted to do for my career. I finished my course
      with D*D*D* and went to Staffordshire University to learn even more about
      game development '
